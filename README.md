 🎯 Goal of the Project
To create a tool where users can enter their date of birth, and it calculates and displays their age in:

Years

Months

Days (optional)

🧩 Key Features
✅ 1. Input Fields
A calendar or date picker to input your birthdate

Optionally: input for current date (or use today’s date automatically)

✅ 2. Calculate Button
When clicked, it triggers the JavaScript function to calculate age

✅ 3. Result Display
Shows the exact age:

X years, Y months, Z days

May also include total:

Days lived, weeks, or even seconds (optional)

✅ 4. Reset Button (optional)
Clears the input and result fields

⚙️ How It Works (JavaScript Logic)
Take the input birthdate

Get the current date

Subtract birth year from current year

Adjust for months/days if birthday hasn't occurred yet this year

Display the result in a readable format
